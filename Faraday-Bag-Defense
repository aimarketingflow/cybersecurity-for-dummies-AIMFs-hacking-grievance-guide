Faraday Bag Defense
Even if your Wi-Fi network is locked down, physical attacks via Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or mobile signals can still reach your devices. This is where Faraday bags come in — they are the digital equivalent of placing your devices inside a shielded vault.
What is a Faraday Bag?
	•	A special pouch that blocks wireless signals including Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, cellular, and GPS.
	•	It prevents outside hacking attempts, tracking, or remote wipes while the device is sealed inside.
	•	Used by security professionals, police, and journalists handling sensitive electronics.
When to Use Faraday Bags
	•	After a Hack: Place suspected infected devices in a Faraday bag immediately to isolate them.
	•	During Network Setup: Keep clean devices separated physically from possibly infected ones while rebuilding.
	•	While Traveling: Protect your phone or laptop from Bluetooth sniffing and tracking.
Pro Tips
	•	Place all devices (laptops, phones, tablets) suspected of infection in separate Faraday bags to prevent cross-contamination.
	•	Even powered-off devices can be hacked. Airplane Mode is not enough protection.
	•	Use Faraday bags rated for Wi-Fi 2.4GHz and 5GHz blocking.
	•	Do not open the bag indoors where Wi-Fi or Bluetooth devices are operating.
