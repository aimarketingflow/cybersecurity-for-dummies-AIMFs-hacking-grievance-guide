Splitting 2.4GHz and 5/6GHz Traffic
Separating your devices across 2.4GHz and 5/6GHz Wi-Fi networks is like organizing your fortress gates — small packages go through one door, sensitive communications go through another.
Why Split Your Traffic?
	•	2.4GHz: Longer range, lower speed, more vulnerable. Best for smart devices (IoT) like cameras, smart bulbs, printers.
	•	5/6GHz: Shorter range, much faster speed, higher security. Best for phones, laptops, gaming consoles, work devices.
By splitting them:
	•	Attackers have a harder time pivoting from an insecure IoT device to your personal computer.
	•	You can turn off the 2.4GHz network when not needed (for added security layers).
	•	Monitoring becomes easier: Less noise on your main device network.
How to Set It Up:
	1	Access Router Settings: Typically at 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.1.
	2	Create Separate SSIDs:
	◦	Example: "HomeSecure-5G" and "HomeSecure-IoT".
	◦	Use strong passwords for both networks.
	3	Use WPA3 on 5/6GHz: If possible, ensure the high-security devices are using WPA3 encryption.
	4	Keep 2.4GHz on WPA2-AES: Necessary for older IoT devices (like Chromecast, security cameras, etc.).
	5	Turn off 2.4GHz when not needed: Use router settings to disable the network during hours when IoT devices aren't needed.

Extra Tip
Some routers let you create a Guest Network. Put visitors or "untrusted" devices on this network — never on your main Wi-Fi!
