Securing Google Workspace Accounts
Google Workspace holds the keys to your business. If attackers gain access, they can compromise not just emails, but documents, user accounts, Google Drive files, and even billing.
Layered Security Approach
	1	Enable 2-Step Verification for All Users:
	‚ó¶	Require 2FA globally via the Admin Console.
	‚ó¶	Options include Google Prompt (on a registered phone), authenticator apps, backup codes, or security keys.
	‚ó¶	‚ö° Important: Plan as if one factor may fail (e.g., phone stolen) ‚Äî have multiple backup methods ready.
	2	Deploy Physical Security Keys (Highly Recommended):
	‚ó¶	USB/NFC keys (like Titan Security Key or YubiKey) are the gold standard.
	‚ó¶	Register multiple keys if possible (main + backup stored offline securely).
	‚ó¶	Remember: If a key is stolen, immediately revoke it in the Admin Console.
	3	Understand Passkeys:
	‚ó¶	Passkeys tie your login to a physical device (e.g., your phone's biometric system).
	‚ó¶	They replace traditional passwords with device-based authentication.
	‚ó¶	Useful but beware ‚Äî if your device is compromised, so is your account access.
	4	Restrict Login by IP Range (If Possible):
	‚ó¶	Allow admin access only from known Wi-Fi networks or VPNs.
	‚ó¶	Block logins from random hotel or public Wi-Fi networks by enforcing context-aware access.
	5	Monitor Your Admin Console:
	‚ó¶	Check Security > Login Audit regularly for suspicious attempts.
	‚ó¶	Force logouts of inactive or suspicious devices immediately.
	6	Disable Outdated 2FA Methods:
	‚ó¶	Remove backup phone numbers or email-based 2FA.
	‚ó¶	Attackers frequently SIM swap to bypass these methods.
Real-World Survival Tip
üì¢ If your passkeys are stolen, do NOT log out of your active device. Google Workspace requires the original authentication to manage users. Instead:
	‚Ä¢	Use "Recover My Account" flow while staying logged into the admin panel.
	‚Ä¢	After recovery, delete all old passkeys and security keys linked to your workspace.
	‚Ä¢	Reset admin passwords directly inside the Google Admin Console, not externally.
