Appendix: IP Subnets Simplified
IP addresses and subnets sound intimidating — but once you get the basics, it's actually logical. Subnets help segment devices on a network, acting like invisible walls inside your digital fortress.
What is an IP Address?
	•	An IP Address is like your device's "home address" on a network. Example: 192.168.1.5
	•	Every device connected to Wi-Fi or Ethernet has one.
What is a Subnet?
	•	A Subnet divides a network into smaller groups to control traffic flow.
	•	It isolates devices — if someone hacks your smart fridge, a good subnet setup keeps them from reaching your laptop.
	•	Subnet masks are written like 255.255.255.0 — think of them like "invisible fences."
Real-World Example
	•	Home Network: 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254 (Router assigns IPs to all devices).
	•	Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0 → Only devices inside 192.168.1.x can talk to each other.
Advanced Threat: Subnet Mask Spoofing
	•	Attackers can spoof subnet masks to make malicious devices appear "safe."
	•	Example: Pretending 203.0.113.50 is part of 192.168.1.x using malicious routing tricks.
	•	This is rare but increasingly possible with AI-assisted hacking tools.
