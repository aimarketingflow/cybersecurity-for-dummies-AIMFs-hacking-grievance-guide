AIMF Fortress Guide to Cyber Defense 2025

Foreword
Hi there,
I am not a certified cybersecurity expert. I’m a tech SEO by background, which – in many ways – is cybersecurity backwards. SEO is about helping the right traffic find you, while cybersecurity is about keeping the wrong traffic out.
Over the past few months, I personally experienced severe identity theft, mail fraud, bank fraud, loan fraud, SIM swapping, and attacks across multiple routers and wireless providers.
In December 2024, I discovered an improper packet warning while using AT&T’s browser connection. Two hours after reporting it, the U.S. Treasury hack was announced publicly.
Based on my experiences, I strongly recommend against using AT&T if you can avoid it. Cox Communications consistently provided better security protections.
I used AI extensively during this process to break down and learn cybersecurity practices in real time.
As part of this, I worked heavily with Windsurf AI to debug issues. I highly caution against using no-code AI systems or downloading packages from third-party sources without fully vetting them. Always research how to properly install and secure packages, especially in Python environments (i.e., use safety.cli and verify dependencies).
A lot of AI platforms now integrate third-party packages without clear vetting, and this can introduce significant vulnerabilities to your systems.
As a big Mr. Robot fan, I grew up believing hacking was like chasing a great white whale – rare, complex, and elite.
But today, hacking has evolved into something far scarier: fishing with dynamite.
AI has made cyberattacks scalable and automated, meaning anyone connected to the internet is at risk, not just governments or corporations.
I hope this guide helps you build your own digital fortress – and protect your business, your work, and your life in this new era.
