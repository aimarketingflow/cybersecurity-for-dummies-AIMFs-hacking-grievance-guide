Fortress Metaphor: How Your Network Becomes a Castle
Imagine your home network as a medieval fortress.
In the old days, castles needed:
	•	Strong walls to keep invaders out (your firewall).
	•	Gates and drawbridges to control entry (your router ports and login systems).
	•	Guards on watchtowers to monitor threats (your device monitors and Wireshark scans).
	•	Secret passages (hidden backdoors like old passwords, forgotten devices, or exposed APIs).
Today, cyber attackers use AI to automatically scan and attack networks. Your goal is to build a modern fortress that can:
	•	Spot intruders before they get in
	•	Automatically close weak points
	•	Defend even when you're asleep
	•	Recover quickly if breached
Fortress Components
	1	Walls: Your firewall settings block unwanted outside traffic. Make them as strong as possible — no open ports unless absolutely needed.
	2	Main Gate: Your router login. Change the default username/password and use strong unique credentials. Think of it like the castle drawbridge: only open when needed, and guarded.
	3	Watchtowers: Use Wireshark, Little Snitch Mini, and network scanners to monitor activity like guards spotting enemies from afar.
	4	Moats and Traps: Disable WPS, disable UPnP, and use guest networks for visitors. These act like fake entrances that confuse or slow down attackers.
	5	Secret Passages: Any old device (like unused phones or IoT gadgets) connected to your network can be an invisible door. Audit and remove old devices!

Why This Matters in 2025
Hacking is no longer manual. It's scalable. If your castle has a flaw, even a small one, it can be exploited automatically by AI bots that run 24/7 without sleep or mercy. Building a 'hardened' structure at the network level is the modern version of survival skills.
