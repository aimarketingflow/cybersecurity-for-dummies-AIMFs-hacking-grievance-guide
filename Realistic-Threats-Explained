Realistic Threats Explained
Cyber threats have evolved. It's no longer about lone wolves trying to break into government servers. Now, AI has weaponized hacking for scale — making almost anyone a target.
Realistic Threat Models for Small Business Owners
	•	SIM Swapping: Attackers hijack your phone number by tricking your carrier. They reset your account passwords via SMS recovery.
	•	Credential Stuffing: Using leaked passwords from other sites to break into your emails, banks, or cloud services.
	•	Phishing Campaigns: Highly targeted fake login pages, using AI-generated convincing emails and websites.
	•	Router Hacking: Attackers exploit default passwords, unpatched firmware, or open ports on home routers.
	•	IoT Device Hopping: Hackers compromise your smart TVs, cameras, light bulbs and pivot into your primary network.
Emerging AI-Driven Risks
	•	Mass AI Scanning: Bots continuously scan public-facing IPs, looking for open doors or old vulnerabilities.
	•	Automated Payloads: Once in, AI scripts instantly upload malware without human interaction.
	•	Network Spoofing: Hackers create fake Wi-Fi networks that mimic trusted brands ("Apple", "Google Guest") to steal credentials.
	•	DNS Poisoning: Redirecting your traffic invisibly to malicious websites even if you typed the right URL.

Defending yourself today requires layers of protection — not just "good passwords" but vigilance across Wi-Fi, hardware, browsers, and user behavior.
