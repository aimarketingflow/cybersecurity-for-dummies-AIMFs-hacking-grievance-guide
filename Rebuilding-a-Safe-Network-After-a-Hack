Rebuilding a Safe Network After a Hack
Once your network is compromised, it’s safer to treat every device and connection as untrustworthy until proven otherwise. Rebuilding smartly is your best defense.
Steps to Rebuild Your Network Safely
	1	Buy a New Router: If you can, replace your old router. Hackers sometimes implant backdoors directly into router firmware.
	2	Set Up the New Router Securely:
	◦	Use all the lockdown settings we discussed earlier.
	◦	Set up different SSIDs for 2.4GHz and 5/6GHz again.
	3	Reset All Devices Before Reconnecting: Factory reset phones, laptops, smart devices before joining them to the new network.
	4	Temporarily Disable All Wireless: Turn off Bluetooth and Wi-Fi completely when setting up clean devices. Use Ethernet only if possible.
	5	Analyze Network Traffic: Install Wireshark or Little Snitch Mini before connecting to anything. Watch your network for any weird connections.
	6	Use a Faraday Bag: Store infected or suspicious devices inside Faraday bags to prevent wireless contamination while rebuilding clean devices.
	7	Scan Everything Before Trusting: Use antivirus, malware scanners, and manual packet inspection to verify a device is clean before reconnecting it.
	8	Install Updates Immediately: Patch everything to the latest software before logging into important accounts (email, banking, etc.).
	9	Delay Adding IoT Devices: Wait until the very end to reconnect smart bulbs, cameras, etc. They are the highest risk.

Pro Tip
⚡ If you're not 100% sure about a device, keep it isolated until you can safely monitor its traffic for a few hours or even days. Trust your data, not the brand name.
