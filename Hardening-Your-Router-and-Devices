Hardening Your Router and Devices
Think of this stage as building up your fortress walls higher and filling the moat with crocodiles.
Critical Router Settings to Change Immediately
	1	Turn Off Remote Management: Disable any remote access to your router admin page. Local access only!
	2	Change Default DNS Servers: Use a secure DNS like Quad9 (9.9.9.9) or Cloudflare (1.1.1.1) to filter malicious traffic.
	3	Disable Multicast and Peer-to-Peer: Prevent your router from broadcasting unnecessarily and being exploited.
	4	Turn Off IPv6 (Optional): IPv6 can sometimes leak additional information. If you don’t need it, turn it off.
	5	Log All Router Traffic: Enable basic logging if your router supports it. This helps you spot anomalies later.
	6	Set Lease Time to Minimum: Shorten DHCP lease times (e.g., 2-4 hours) to prevent devices from "squatting" on the network longer than necessary.
Securing Devices Before They Connect
	1	Reset Devices: Factory reset all devices that connected to your old Wi-Fi before reconnecting them.
	2	Update All Firmware: Immediately update to the latest software available for laptops, phones, cameras, etc.
	3	Install Monitoring Tools: Add apps like Little Snitch Mini (Mac) or GlassWire (Windows) to track network activity.
	4	Install Antivirus and Anti-malware: Even if you’re cautious, a second layer of scanning helps spot dormant infections.
	5	Prefer Ethernet Connections: Connect critical devices (like workstations) directly via Ethernet whenever possible to reduce wireless attack surfaces.

Pro Tip
Check the device list inside your router’s admin panel regularly. If you see devices with strange names or MAC addresses you don’t recognize, investigate immediately!
