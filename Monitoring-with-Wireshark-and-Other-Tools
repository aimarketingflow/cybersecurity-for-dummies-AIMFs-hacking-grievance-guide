Monitoring with Wireshark and Other Tools
After rebuilding your network, the work isn’t over. Constant monitoring keeps you ahead of any sneaky threats trying to creep back in.
Using Wireshark on Desktop
	1	Install on a Clean Machine: Preferably from the official website: https://www.wireshark.org/
	2	Run in Monitor Mode: Capture packets even if they aren't addressed directly to you (if supported).
	3	Look for:
	◦	Strange DNS requests (especially odd subdomains).
	◦	Constant outbound connections to unknown IPs.
	◦	Unusual TCP/UDP ports being used.
	4	Use Visualizations: Use the I/O Graphs to spot traffic bursts from hacked devices when they turn on or connect.
Using pcapdroid on Android
	1	Install pcapdroid: Download from F-Droid or GitHub for safer versions.
	2	Record Network Logs: Save .pcap files onto an external flash drive.
	3	Analyze Later: Open those .pcap files in Wireshark for deeper inspection.
Using Little Snitch Mini on Mac
	1	Monitor Outbound Connections: Instantly see what’s trying to "call home" from your Mac.
	2	Block Suspicious Domains: Allow only what you explicitly trust.
	3	Use 'Restart From Now' Feature: Reset traffic logs and test live what connections happen when you open specific apps or websites.

Pro Tip
Shorten your Wireshark capture lengths. Capture 10-30 second windows to reduce noise and spot patterns more easily. Export suspicious segments as individual files for AI analysis.
