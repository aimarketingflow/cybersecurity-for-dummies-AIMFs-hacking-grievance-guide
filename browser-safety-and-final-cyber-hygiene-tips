Browser Safety and Final Cyber Hygiene Tips
Web browsers are one of the biggest open doors to your fortress. Choosing the right one and using it properly can make all the difference.

Browser Behavior Tips
	1	Block all third-party cookies.
	2	Use strict or custom DNS settings: (e.g., Quad9 or Cloudflare). Consider adding DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH).
	3	Disable browser password managers. Use external password managers instead (but vet them carefully!).
	4	Whitelist Websites: Only allow connections to websites you intentionally visit.
	5	Inspect Websites: Use DevTools (Inspect Element) to identify necessary resources to load safely (Hana's YouTube video guide forthcoming!).
Extra Final Tips
	‚Ä¢	Always prefer Ethernet to Wi-Fi when setting up anything sensitive.
	‚Ä¢	Don't trust any device fully until you've watched its network behavior for a few days.
	‚Ä¢	Don‚Äôt reuse passwords anywhere ‚Äî use a unique one for every site.
	‚Ä¢	Enable alerts on your email and bank accounts for every login.
	‚Ä¢	Backup critical files to an offline device (external SSD, encrypted if possible).
