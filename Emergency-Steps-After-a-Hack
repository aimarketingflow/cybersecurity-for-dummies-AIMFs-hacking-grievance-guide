Emergency Steps After a Hack
If you believe you've been hacked, act fast but calmly. Treat it like a digital fire drill: the earlier you move, the more you can save.
Immediate Actions
	1	Disconnect Internet Immediately: Unplug your router and disable Wi-Fi on all devices.
	2	Power Down Devices: Shut down phones, laptops, tablets completely.
	3	Faraday Bag Compromised Devices: Place any devices you suspect are compromised into Faraday bags to prevent remote tampering.
Recovery Process
	1	Start Fresh: Ideally, use new hardware for recovery. If that's not possible, factory reset infected devices without reconnecting to the internet first.
	2	Secure Your Admin Accounts: Prioritize Workspace Admin Console access. Stay logged in if possible; do not force a logout if you lose passkeys.
	3	Backup Remaining Clean Data: Use encrypted external drives, not cloud services.
	4	Rebuild Network Safely: Replace the router, set new Wi-Fi SSID and passwords, isolate 2.4GHz devices separately.
Important Tips
	•	Don't reuse old passwords — use a clean password manager like Proton Pass after reset.
	•	Audit your recovery emails and backup phone numbers linked to critical accounts.
	•	If your phone number was stolen (SIM swap), contact your provider’s fraud department immediately.
	•	Report identity theft to the FTC: https://www.identitytheft.gov/
